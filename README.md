Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to check out my project. 
I noticed how lopsided some of Vegas' lines were for NFL player props, and wanted to take a deeper look at finding trends that may give me an edge in the sports betting world.

# Motivation

An analyst on Twitter had mentioned that Amari Cooper dominates as a home favorite. 
When the Dallas Cowboys are at home and favored by at least 3 points, Amari Cooper posts unreal stats. 
I created a bar plot (code to be posted down the line) and noticed that Amari Cooper averaged 110 yards at home, and only 49 yards on the road.

This motivated me to create a viz for any player, their per game home/away splits and what the Vegas spread/total was.
